#- Robots?
#- My friend had one.

#- It was shiny, and metal.

#- It made noises. Like "Bleep" and "Boop".

#- My friend said that he found it in a mud pile, and the robot told him that it was from the year "2070XX".

#- A time which humans were extinct, and robots fought aliens in anime style battles.


#- I didn't know whether to believe my friend, because I'd only heard the robot talk one time:


#- It was late at night, and I was talking to my friend on the "Landline".



#- He'd fallen asleep, so I was about to hang up, but I heard the robot sing.



#- I didn't know the song, but the robot was repeating the words.


#- My mom was awake, and she heard my phone call, and told me the next day that the song that the robot was singing was called:


#- "Bad Passion".


#- Well, robots.

#- Goodbye for now.
