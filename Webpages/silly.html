    <h1> Silly </h1>
    <p> Silly is silly. "<b>silly = silly</b>" We are silly. </p>
    <p>
      One day, a silly man named <b><q>Joe</q></b> went down from his house to the local diner. He ordered soup for breakfast. Then, he ordered eggs for lunch. Finally, he ordered a sandwich for dinner. <br>
      The total for the food was 17.50. <b><q>Joe</q></b> said that he had no money. <b><q>The cook</q></b> said that <b><q>Joe</q></b> would have to work the money off. <b><q>Joe</q></b> said he would rather go to prison than work off the debt. <br>
      <b><q>The cook</q></b> said he would call the police, and dialed 911. <b><q>Joe</q></b> ran out of the diner, and into a portal to the next dimension. <b><q>Joe</q></b> became a pile of meat gel, then he teleported into the mayonnaise dimension. <br> 
      The problem is, he needs bread to complete his sandwich. <br>
      Then, <b><q>Walter</q></b> pulled out two slices of bread and ate <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>. <br>
      While <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> was being digested, he thought to himself <q>This is a very bad day.</q><br>
      The next day, the police found the portal and went through it, but they melted into meat, but they dropped their guns, and shot <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>. <br>
      But <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> was unharmed because he was a sandwich inside of <b><q>Walter</q></b>. Next, <b><q>Walter</q></b> ate the police, and said "Har Har Har, you cannot defeat me." <br>
      <b><q>Walter</q></b>'s brother <b><q>White</q></b> appeared and tried to fight <b><q>Walter</q></b> for <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>. <br>
      <b><q>White</q></b> died after being hit 384 times, turned into a tesseract, and  <b><q>Walter</q></b> ate him. <br>
      Then, the portal malfunctioned and sucked everyone into <b><q>Walter</q></b>'s mouth. <br>
      As it turns out, <b><q>Walter</q></b> is the commander of a legion of 4D Ascended beings. He decided it would be a good idea to invade every other dimension. <br>
      Even though 5D beings have more dimension than 4D, <b><q>Walter</q></b> is a amazing commander and his troops are Ascended Beings. They defeated the 5D beings and consumed them.<br> 
      Then, they repeated this for every other dimension. <br>
      After doing this, <b><q>Walter</q></b> decided to play a round of 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel. He defeated his opponent, and then decided to play the game "Breaking Bad" for the 3DS. <br> 
      <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> sabotaged his game by using his MT-12 100-mm anti-tank gun, thus destroying <b><q>Walter</q></b>'s 3DS. <br>
      <b><q>Walter</q></b> decided to use the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Gambit, thus destroying <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>'s 100-mm anti-tank gun, and beginning a conflict that would end the peace established by <b><q>Walter</q></b>'s conquest of the other dimensions, and causing fighting to last for billions of years to come.<br>
      Billions of years later, <b><q>Walter</q></b> finally defeated <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> but only after many hard-fought battles with trillions of casualties. <br>
      <b><q>Walter</q></b> decided to have <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> put on trial for war crimes. <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>'s was convicted of war crimes, and executed because he caused billions of civilian casualties. <br>
      In fact, <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> wasn't executed but one of the police men from the 3rd Dimension had been in his place. <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> spent 32 years in hiding before beginning a coup d'état against <b><q>Walter</q></b>. <br>
      Before <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> killed <b><q>Walter</q></b>, <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> forced <b><q>Walter</q></b> to tell him how to ascend to a higher plane of existence. <b><q>Walter</q></b>, knowing that he was going to die, told <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> how to ascend. <br>
      <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> then shot & killed <b><q>Walter</q></b>.  After fleeing the scene, <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> ascended to the cheese dimension. <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> began exploring the cheese dimension. <br>
      <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> explored for 44 years, until he found a being named "The Shredded Cheese Man". <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> decided that it would be a good idea to go to sleep. He slept until 2:30am, when he heard a noise, coming from his refrigerator. <br>
      <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> opened the refrigerator, and saw <b><q>The Shredded Cheese Man</q></b>. <b><q>The Shredded Cheese Man</q></b> said to him, <q>Come with me, I have your greatest desires.</q> <br>
      <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> followed <b><q>The Shredded Cheese Man</q></b> into the refrigerator. <br>
      <b><q>The Shredded Cheese Man</q></b> said to <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>, “You are an idiot.” <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> immediately turned on his portable television, and received this broadcast: <br>
      From the United States Bureau of Shredded Cheese Man Containment: 
      <q>Your midnight cravings allowed you to be tempted by the shredded cheese man. <br> 
        You have satisfied your hunger, but at what cost?<br>
        Do not allow yourself to fall for such tricks. <br>
        Educate yourself about the dangers of shredded cheese.<br>
        This unidentified man has been attempting to lure people into the refrigerator during the hours of two to four am mountain time by offering most notably, shredded cheese. <br>
        He has also been sighted tempting victims with raw sticks of butter, dry rigatoni, and a brick.<br>
        If you see him, immediately contact the federal bureau of shredded cheese man containment. <br>
        Do not fall for his tactics, for he is but an illusion. <br>
        What should you do if you suspect your refrigerator has been possessed by the shredded cheese man?<br>
        Fortunately for you, there are multiple options. However, be warned. <br>
        Do not attempt to destroy or move the refrigerator, such as by C4 explosive or 120mm depleted uranium sabot round.<br>
        After it has been altered by the shredded cheese man, the refrigerator will become indestructible and immovable. <br>
        If you attempt to tamper with a possessed refrigerator in any way, you will scream. Your first line of defense is to try to ignore the cheese man. <br>
        He is not real. He is merely a projection of your mind. <br>
        No matter how scary he is, he will never be able to manifest himself in a physical form unless you allow yourself to indulge in the mirage of midnight shredded cheese. <br>
        He will try harder each night to tempt you.<br> 
        You will have to resist his increasingly alluring offers. <br>
        Do not ever open the refrigerator door when you know he is there. <br>
        Once he appears, his temptations will become irresistible, and your fate will have been determined.<br>
        You may attempt to prevent the shredded cheese man from materializing by constantly maintaining eye contact with your refrigerator. <br>
        However, if you choose this path, you cannot look away from the refrigerator unless there is someone else to take your place.<br>
        There must always be a set of eyes on the refrigerator, for the second you look away, the shredded cheese man will appear and commit insurance fraud.<br>
        If all else fails, you must immediately leave the area. You are not safe. He will follow you everywhere, no matter how remote your location is. Move frequently, for he is always searching. <br>
        He can be observed driving a really sick 1988 Nissan 2000 Skyline GTS-R. If you see him outside your house, know that your time on this mortal plane is limited. <br>
        <b>Do not approach the vehicle.</b> <br>
        Remember, he is not real, and you are merely hallucinating his physical presence as he attempts to possess your mind and take your body as a physical vessel to the tangible world. <br>
        You are a nomad now. You cannot avoid the shredded cheese man. <br>
        You live off the land and never settle. Was this limitless life of freedom worth the sacrifice of shredded cheese? <br>
        You do not have time to consider this, for you must now move again. Is this how life was meant to be lived? <br>
        You cannot remember the last time you worried about something, except for the shredded cheese man of course. <br>
        But you cannot have everything. You yearn for the open road. <br> 
        You know the entire world like the back of your hand. The earth is your backyard.<br> <!-- Yeah, funny number. So funny. Literally rolling on the floor laughing.-->
        With this knowledge, you begin visit people’s houses and disappear at will. <br>
        You have experienced the quirks and hallmarks of every culture in every corner of human civilization. <br>
        But you want more. This limiting physical existence holds you back. <br>
        You now have the overwhelming desire to lure people into the indefinite limbo of transitional space so that you may create a copy of your consciousness and populate the world with other people’s bodies that have your mind. <br>
        <p><b><q>Indeed, you are now the shredded cheese man.</q></b></p>
      <p><b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> knew what he had to do. 
      He drove away in his 1992 Alfa Romeo 155, and kept driving.
      <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> is a nomad now. <br>
      He lives off the land, but never settles. <br>
      He yearns for the open road, as the earth is his backyard. <br>
      He knows the world like the back of his hand. He wants more. <br>
      His limiting physical existence holds him back. <br>
      He has experienced the quirks and hallmarks of every culture in every corner of human civilization. <br>
      Indeed, he is now <b><q>The Shredded Cheese Man</q></b>. <br>
      But, <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> ascended to not become <b><q>The Shredded Cheese Man</q></b>.
      Although <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> was not <b><q>The Shredded Cheese Man</q></b> anymore, he still wanted to lure people into the <b><q>indefinite limbo</q></b> of transitional space so that he may create a copy of his consciousness and populate the world with other people’s bodies that have his mind. <br>
      The real <b><q>Walter</q></b>, who had not been shot, vowed to get revenge on <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>. <br>
      <b><q>Walter</q></b> knew that <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> was in a ascended plane of existence, but he did not know which one. <br>
      He sent out his agents to search the ascended planes and traverse the lands. <br>
      After 100 years, <b><q>Walter</q></b>’s agents found <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b>. <br>
      <b><q>Meat-Joe</q></b> sent out his general, <b><q>The Ramen Guy</q></b>, with a force of many troops, many many troops, more troops than you know, more troops than ever before, more troops than have ever existed, 2x more troops, forever more troops, and defeated <b><q>Walter</q></b>’s special agent,  <b><q>‘Waldo Walt “I Ate My Kids For 352 years” Willy III’</q></b>, in 11.4089795319 years. <br>
      <b><q>Waldo Walt “I Ate My Kids For 352 years” Willy III</q></b> died after an intense battle where he killed <br>
      <b><q>3838423743664868433748234772845383432843834+e485734275837487487537</q></b> troops from <b><q>The Ramen Guy</q></b>’s army, though <b><q>‘Waldo Walt “I Ate My Kids For 352 years” Willy III’</q></b> died from 869576650204e+16 bullet and various assorted wounds. <br>
      <b><q>‘Waldo Walt “I Ate My Kids For 352 years” Willy III’</q></b>’s death was not in vain, as he deleted a lot of <b><q>The Ramen Guy</q></b>’s troops from existence. <br> <b><q>Walter</q></b> said to himself, <q>Goodbye, Waldo Walt “I Ate My Kids For 352 years” Willy III.</q> <b><q>Walter</q></b> did not know what to do. <br> 
      <b><q>Walter</q></b> waited an eternity. </p>
