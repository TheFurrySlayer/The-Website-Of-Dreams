    <p> One day, a silly man named <b>Joe</b> went down from his house to the local diner. He ordered soup for breakfast. Then, he ordered eggs for lunch. Finally, he ordered a sandwich for dinner.  <!--Joe says hi--> The total for the food was 17.50. <b>Joe</b> said that he had no money. <b>The cook</b> said that <b>Joe</b> would have to work the money off. <b>Joe</b> said he would rather go to prison than work off the debt.
      <b>The cook</b> said he would call the police, and dialed 911. <b>Joe</b> ran out of the diner, and into a portal to the next dimension. <b>Joe</b> became a pile of meat gel, then he teleported into the mayonnaise dimension. The problem is, he needs bread to complete his sandwich, which he didn't get because he didn't have money. Then, <b>Walter</b> pulled out two slices of bread and ate <b>Joe</b>.
      While <b>Joe</b> was being digested, he thought to himself "This is a very bad day." The next day, the police found the portal and went through it, but they melted into meat, but they dropped their guns, and shot <b>Meat-Joe</b>. But <b>Meat-Joe</b> was unharmed because he was a sandwich inside of <b>Walter</b>.
      Next, <b>Walter</b> ate the police, and said "Har Har Har, you cannot defeat me." <b>Walter</b>'s brother <b>White</b> appeared and tried to fight <b>Walter</b> for <b>Meat-Joe</b>. <b>White</b> died after being hit 384 times. He then turned into a tesseract and died, and <b>Walter</b> ate him. Then, the portal malfunctioned and sucked everyone into <b>Walter</b>'s mouth.
      As it turns out, <b>Walter</b> is the commander of a legion of 4D Ascended beings. He decided it would be a good idea to invade every other dimension. Even though 5D beings have more dimension(sic) than 4D, <b>Walter</b> is a amazing commander and his troops are Ascended Beings. They defeated the 5D beings and consumed them. Then they repeated this for ever other dimension.
      After doing this, <b>Walter</b> decided to play a round of 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel. He defeated his opponent, and then decided to play the game "Breaking Bad" for the 3DS. <b>Meat-Joe</b> sabotaged his game by using his MT-12 100-mm anti-tank gun, thus destroying <b>Walter</b>'s 3DS. <b>Walter</b> decided to use the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Gambit, thus destroying <b>Meat-Joe</b>'s 100-mm anti-tank gun, and beginning a conflict that would end the peace established by <b>Walter</b>'s conquest of the other dimension, and causing fighting to last for billions of years to come.
      Billions of years later, <b>Walter</b> finally defeated <b>Meat-Joe</b> but only after many hard-fought battles with millions of casualities(sic). <b>Walter</b> decided to have <b>Meat-Joe</b> put on trial for war crimes. <b>Meat-Joe</b>'s was convicted of war crimes, and excuted(sic) because he caused billions of civilian casualties. 
      Infact, <b>Meat-Joe</b> wasn't executed but one of the police men from the 3rd Dimension had been in his place. <b>Meat-Joe</b> spent 32 years in hiding before beginning a coup d'état against <b>Walter</b>. Before <b>Meat-Joe</b> killed <b>Walter</b>, <b>Meat-Joe</b> forced <b>Walter</b> to tell him how to ascend to a higher plane of existence. <b>Walter</b>, knowing that he was going to die, told <b>Meat-Joe</b> how to ascend.
      <b>Meat-Joe</b> then shot & killed <b>Walter</b>.  After fleeing the scene, <b>Meat-Joe</b> ascended to the cheese dimension. <b>Meat-Joe</b> began exploring the cheese dimension.
      <b>Meat-Joe</b> explored for 44 years, until he found a being named "The Shredded Cheese Man". <b>Meat-Joe</b> decided that it would be a good idea to go to sleep. He slept until 2:30am, when he heard a noise, coming from his refrigerator. <b>Meat-Joe</b> opened the refrigerator, and saw <b>The Shredded Cheese Man</b>. <b>The Shredded Cheese Man</b> said to him, “Come with me, I have your greatest desires.” <b>Meat-Joe</b> followed <b>The Shredded Cheese Man</b> into the refrigerator. <b>The Shredded Cheese Man</b> said to <b>Meat-Joe</b>, “You are an idiot.” <b>Meat-Joe</b> immediately turned on his portable television, and received this broadcast: <br>
