<p>
   P-38 Lightning:
   Pretty good. It's a bit slow for my tastes, but not that bad. A good choice for beginners. <br>
   I find that the formation attack varies from so/so to pretty bad. The formation attack fires straight forward. <br>
   Good for a bit extra firepower, but the targeting missiles that the wingman fire are really good. <br>
   The bomb is atrocious, as it launches forward in a circular shockwave and explosion. <br>
   It doesn't even clear the screen, which is what the bombs are supposed to do. <br>
   The one good thing is that it clears more of the screen than the Shinden. <br>
   I did feel the firepower was a bit lacking, but overall, a pretty good plane. Good for people new to the game. <br>

   P-51 Mustang:
   Ok. A step up from the P-38. The formation attack is my favorite out of all of them, as it clears bullets in a spinning motion. <br>
   Again, I find the firepower lacking a bit, and the bomb being bad. Though it does have a cool animation. <br>
   The bomb has 3 bombers drop cluster bombs over the entire screen, clearing it completely. <br>
   It's pretty weak, and I found myself using it multiple times against one stage of a boss, unlike other plane's bombs, which make a clean kill each use. <br>
   And the spread of the fire is quite large, which normally would be good, but the spread is a bit too much, and makes it harder to hit what I want to hit. <br>
   Overall, again pretty good, but definitely could be better, and as the plane is basically the starter option (even though the P-38 comes first in the list.) <br>

   Spitfire:
   Another solid entry. Nice speed and firepower. <br>
   I really like that it has energy blasts instead of missiles, and that the wingmen follow you in a trail, sort of like the options from Lifeforce/Salamander. Way to mix it up <br>
   Like before, the bullet spread is a bit too much for me, but I do like this plane a lot more than the P-38 or P-51. <br>
   The formation attack is very, very good. It attacks at a length ahead of you, and diagonally, but stays in line with you. <br>
   Really liked the formation attack. Though, I did find myself using the formation more than not. <br> 
   And the bomb is very cool too. It's a giant laser, which makes you impervious to all attacks. <br>
   Also, it's really fun to have your formation attack going with a bomb active. Just amazing how many enemies you can kill. <br>
   And the balancing on it is very nice. It slows you down a bit, but not too much or too little, which I think really makes you think about when to use it. <br>
   The animation's cool too. Would have liked a bit more firepower, but that's a bit of a nitpick. <br>
   Overall, a very good plane, and one that I don't give enough credit to, since I main Shinden. <br>
  
   Bf-109:
   Good speed, ok firepower. <br>
   I love the wingmen. The fact that they target enemies is really good. <br>
   It's at it's best when you have to dodge bullets from a boss, and can't hit it, but you're wingmen are shooting tons of shells at the boss. <br>
   The formation attack is okay, and it does look cool, but I'd stick to regular shots. <br>
   Also, I'm glad that there is basically no spread for it's shots, because of the wingmen. <br>
   The firepower is better than the other planes previously mentioned, mostly because of bullet spray, but also because it just fires more shells. <br>
   The bomb is a bit weak, but I love the animation. It's really cool, sort of builds on the P-51 but actually makes it good. <br>
   Plus, the animation is good because your plane goes up in the air and does a loop. Really makes me happy when I see it. <br>
   Especially since it's just showing off the hardware's capabilities. <br>
   The wingmen could aim a bit better, but again a minor nitpick. 
   I really don't give this one enough credit, mostly because it's bomb is not as flashy as the Spitfire's. <br>

   Zero:
   Great speed, pretty good firepower. <br>
   The formation attack is basically what the Bf-109's wingmen do normally. <br>
   I have to say, it's really annoying charging up my formation attack only for the wingmen to immediately target a regular plane, and waste most of it's charge time. <br>
   Not a minor nitpick this time, since it really weakens what would be a solid formation attack. <br>
   The best thing about this plane is that it does what the P-38, P-51, and Spitfire were trying to do with bullet spread. <br>
   It has some spreading, but not too much to make it hard to hit anything, or too little, making it go in a straight line. <br>
   Another thing I noticed is that the Zero rips through bosses like they're made of butter or something. <br>
   I was gonna say this was a bit underpowered in the firepower, but no. It's really overpowered in this department. <br>
   The bomb is a little weaker than I want it to be, but it fills the screen, and is what the P-51 was trying to do. <br>
   I don't really know what the developers, Psikyo, were trying to go for with this, the best guess I have is the Kamikaze, or Divine Wind. <br> 
   (The kind that destroyed Kublai Khan's fleet, not suicide pilots.) Though it does look very good, especially the blue lighting. <br>
   Overall, very good.

   Shinden:
   This is the plane I always play. <br>
   It is very fast, and has the best firepower (by far). <br>
   It's ridiculously overpowered, in almost every way. The firepower, even unupgraded rips through bosses, <br>
   the formation attack fires many, many bullets, the bomb annihilates bosses, and it's speed makes it easy to dodge bullets. <br>
   Now onto the ways it's not so good. The missiles aren't as fast as the Spitfire's, and the formation attack is a bit generic. <br>
   The bomb is my favorite, even though I already said this. It's really good, and it looks really cool. <br>
   Basically what the bomb does is the Shinden makes a plasma copy of itself which is launched forward, causing destruction everywhere. <br>
   Anyways, I don't really have anything else to say that I haven't already said. <br>
